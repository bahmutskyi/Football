By downloading our Dock Menu FX you have access to one of the most customizable Flash component on the internet. All of our components are XML driven, so there is no need to use Adobe Flash to change the component's attributes or its assets.
The easiest way to start customizing our product is with its LiveDemo, which has all the component's attributes available.
